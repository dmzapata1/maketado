    <p>
      Please read these Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") carefully as
      they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized
      services for streaming music and other content, including all of our
      websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms
      (collectively, the "<strong>Spotify Service</strong>") and any music,
      videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available
      through the Spotify Service ("<strong>Content</strong>").

      and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are
      made part of these Terms by this reference.

    <p>
      By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to
      these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the
      Spotify Service or access any Content.
    </p>

    <p>
      THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET
      FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL
      BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT
      PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS
      DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
